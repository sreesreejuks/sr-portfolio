        <p class="intro">Greetings, traveler! You've stumbled upon my little digital haven—where ideas, stories, and interests come together.</p>
        <p class="body">
            I’m <strong>Sreeju KS</strong>, a DevOps engineer by profession and a lifelong learner by choice. My career revolves around streamlining workflows and building resilient systems, but outside of work, I have a few passions that keep me grounded: photography, occasional reading, grooving to music, and exploring the world on my bike when the road calls.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            Currently based in Kochi, Kerala, I’m on a journey of growth, blending my professional pursuits with personal interests like learning AWS and mastering the piano—dreaming of playing pieces by Beethoven or tracks from Interstellar.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            Born and raised in Kottayam, Kerala, I’ve always been curious about how things work, which led me down the path of technology. When I’m not immersed in coding or tinkering with cloud architecture, I enjoy quiet moments, rebuilding my goals <em>“brick by brick”</em>, and embracing the beauty of slow mornings.
        </p>
        <p class="outro">
            Life’s good, and I’m just getting started.
